this file tells how to use this ddos_det file locally and find ddos  possible ddos attacks launching to your server


✅ Phase 4: DDoS Simulation, Suricata Log Reset, and Detection Analysis
🔹 Step 1: Stop Suricata and Clean Up
Before clearing logs, ensure Suricata is stopped completely.

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo systemctl stop suricata || sudo pkill suricata
sudo rm -f /run/suricata.pid
sudo rm -f /var/run/suricata-command.socket
🔹 Step 2: Clear Suricata Logs
Empty the existing eve.json log to start fresh:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo truncate -s 0 /var/log/suricata/eve.json
# OR
sudo sh -c '> /var/log/suricata/eve.json'
This resets the log without deleting the file.

🔹 Step 3: Identify the Correct Network Interface
Find your real network interface (important in VMs):

bash
Copy
Edit
ip a
Look for names like enp0s3, eth0, etc.

🔹 Step 4: Start Suricata in Live Monitoring Mode
Use the correct interface name here:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo suricata -i enp0s3 -D
-i = Interface to monitor

-D = Daemon mode (background)

Validate Suricata is running:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo systemctl status suricata
🔹 Step 5: Confirm Log Activity
In a separate terminal, tail the eve.json log:

bash
Copy
Edit
tail -f /var/log/suricata/eve.json
Now generate normal traffic (e.g., browse a website) to verify logs are being written.

🔹 Step 6: Run Your Python Detection Script
Ensure your DDoS detection code is running and reading eve.json:

bash
Copy
Edit
python3 ddos_det.py
Make sure it’s actively listening or polling the log file.

🔹 Step 7: Launch the DDoS Simulation
Use hping3 to flood your machine:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo hping3 -c 10000 -d 120 -S -w 64 -p 80 --flood --rand-source <your-ip>
Replace <your-ip> with your actual IP (127.0.0.1 for localhost or get via ip a)

This command creates a SYN flood

🔹 Step 8: Watch for Detection
While the attack is running:

Monitor eve.json via tail -f

Look for Suricata alerts like TCP Flood or Potential DDoS

Your Python script should output something like:

yaml
Copy
Edit
🛑 Potential attack detected from IP: <ip>
⚠️ Action: Blocking IP... [Simulated]
✅ Success Criteria
eve.json is actively logging alerts

Your Python script correctly flags the attack

Suricata runs without interface or socket issues

💡 Optional: Automation Script
If you'd like, I can help write a Bash script to:

Stop Suricata

Clear logs

Restart Suricata

Tail logs and simulate attack
